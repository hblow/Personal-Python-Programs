======================
Japanese Word List
======================
The name is from a previous iteration of this program.
This program creates a words.txt file which contains
user inputted English words and subsequent Japanese
equivalent. The user is allowed to add, delete, and
update entries into this file.

======================
Requirements
======================
Depends on the quicksort program created by myself to be
included in the same folder to work correctly.

======================
Future Plans
======================
1. Within the same program or seperate, allow for testing 
of words in a randomized format and assign difficulties 
to each(either user inputted or based on other parameters
like length).
2. Allow for seperate categories in the words.txt folder
like Words, places, people, etc.
3. Perhaps implement a UI for the program to learn how to
create UI and for easier use.
